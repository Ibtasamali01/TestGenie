# 🧩 Groom Levels Implementation - Streamlined to Top 3

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The GroomRoom Refinement Agent has been updated with **3 streamlined Groom Levels** based on your workflow and QA refinement focus.

---

## 🎯 **Top 3 Groom Levels**

### 1. **Insight (Balanced Groom)**
**Purpose:** Balanced depth — ideal for refinement meetings and sprint grooming.

**What It Displays:**
- Sprint Readiness %
- Definition of Ready (DoR) coverage summary
- Gaps and weak areas (fields missing or unclear)
- INVEST & ACCEPT scores (with 1-line explanation each)
- Suggested Acceptance Criteria and Test Scenarios
- Story rewrite (if clarity issue detected)
- QA test coverage notes (from Test Scenario extraction)

**Display Style:** Readable summary with short sections and scorebars. No raw JSON — just structured text.

**Example Output:**
```
🔍 Insight Analysis (Story: OUT-4213)

Readiness: 82% (Needs minor refinement)
Weak Areas: ADA Criteria, Edge Case missing

Story Clarity: Good — Persona and Goal detected ✅  
Suggested rewrite: "As a shopper, I want to apply discount codes easily so that I can save on purchases."

AC Quality: 4 found (1 vague)
→ Add AC for expired coupon handling

Suggested Test Scenarios:
• Positive: Apply valid coupon  
• Negative: Invalid code shows error  
• Error: API timeout fallback handled

Framework Summary:
ROI: 27 | INVEST: 26 | ACCEPT: 22 | 3C: 9
```

---

### 2. **Actionable (QA + DoR Coaching)**
**Purpose:** Deep, prescriptive mode — used when preparing tickets for sprint commitment or QA handoff.

**What It Displays:**
- Full structured Groom Analysis JSON (summarised visually)
- Readiness Score + DoR checklist
- Detailed recommendations for **PO, QA, and Dev** separately
- Rewritten ACs (free-form format, not just Gherkin)
- Suggested missing Test Scenarios (positive/negative/error)
- Accessibility or Technical field warnings
- Optional section: DesignSync summary (if Figma linked)

**Display Style:** Expandable sections or collapsible accordions per area (Story, AC, Test, Technical, ADA). Use bullet-point recommendations.

**Example Output:**
```
⚡ Actionable Groom Report (OUT-4213)
Readiness: 74% | Status: ⚠️ Needs Refinement  

🧩 User Story
- Persona/Goal found ✅  
- Benefit unclear → Suggested rewrite provided  
- Missing business metric reference (ROI impact)

✅ Acceptance Criteria
- 5 detected | 2 need rewriting for measurability  
Suggested rewrite examples:
1. "Display success toast when valid coupon applied."
2. "Show clear error message for expired code."

🧪 QA Scenarios
- Add test for multiple coupon attempts
- Negative flow missing for network failure

🧱 Technical / ADA
- Missing Architectural Solution link  
- No ADA criteria for contrast or keyboard focus
```

---

### 3. **Summary (Concise, Executive Snapshot)**
**Purpose:** Quick view for leads or refinement dashboards.

**What It Displays:**
- Story title + key fields
- DoR coverage %
- Readiness level (Ready / Needs Refinement / Not Ready)
- Top 3 Gaps + Recommended Actions
- Framework averages (no breakdown)

**Display Style:** Compact, single-card summary view (like Jira comment or dashboard tile).

**Example Output:**
```
📋 Summary — OUT-4213 | Sprint Readiness: 82%
Status: ⚠️ Needs Refinement  

Top Gaps:
1. ADA Acceptance Criteria missing  
2. Edge case AC not defined  
3. Component field blank  

Recommended Actions:
→ Add ADA coverage note  
→ Define AC for invalid coupon  
→ Populate Component (Checkout Module)
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Updated Methods in `groomroom/core.py`:

1. **`_format_insight_output()`** - Formats output for Insight mode
2. **`_format_actionable_output()`** - Formats output for Actionable mode  
3. **`_format_summary_output()`** - Formats output for Summary mode
4. **`_generate_qa_notes()`** - Generates QA-specific notes from test scenarios

### Updated CLI in `groomroom/cli.py`:
- Simplified mode choices to: `['insight', 'actionable', 'summary']`
- Updated help text with clear descriptions

### New Configuration:
```python
self.groom_levels = {
    'insight': {
        'name': 'Insight (Balanced Groom)',
        'description': 'Balanced analysis — highlights clarity, ACs, QA scenarios.',
        'purpose': 'Ideal for refinement meetings and sprint grooming',
        'output_style': 'readable_summary'
    },
    'actionable': {
        'name': 'Actionable (QA + DoR Coaching)',
        'description': 'Full prescriptive refinement guidance, includes rewrites.',
        'purpose': 'Deep, prescriptive mode for sprint commitment or QA handoff',
        'output_style': 'structured_sections'
    },
    'summary': {
        'name': 'Summary (Snapshot)',
        'description': 'Concise overview for leads and dashboards.',
        'purpose': 'Quick view for leads or refinement dashboards',
