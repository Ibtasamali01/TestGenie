# 📋 Today's Changes Summary

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Committed, ⏳ Ready to Push

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed Today

### 1. **EpicRoast Endpoint Fix** 🔧
- **File:** `app.py`
- **Change:** Added `/api/epicroast/generate` endpoint
- **Why:** Frontend was calling `/generate` but backend only had `/roast`
- **Line Added:** Line 511 in `app.py`
```python
@app.route('/api/epicroast/generate', methods=['POST'])
```

### 2. **Emoji Encoding Fix** ✅
- **Files:** `groomroom/core_no_scoring.py`
- **Change:** Removed ALL emojis from report headings
- **Replaced With:** ASCII characters like `[+]`, `[-]`, `[!]`, `[READY]`, etc.
- **Why:** Emojis were showing as garbled characters (e.g., `âš¡ ðŸ"‹`)
- **Result:** Clean, readable reports

### 3. **Deployment Preparation** 🚀
- **Files:** Multiple new documentation files
- **Change:** Complete deployment guides for Vercel + Render
- **Result:** Ready for production deployment
