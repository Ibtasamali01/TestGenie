# Ticket Summary  
Enable ClearPay as a new payment option during the EMEA checkout flow so EMEA customers can select and complete orders using ClearPay.

# Acceptance Criteria (Refined & Testable)  
1. Payment Option Visibility  
   * On checkout for orders shipped to supported EMEA country codes [list to be provided], “ClearPay” appears alongside existing payment methods.  
   * ClearPay does not appear for non-EMEA regions or when the ClearPay feature flag is disabled (if applicable).

2. Integration & Order Completion  
   * Selecting ClearPay initiates the ClearPay payment flow (redirection or in-app modal) and returns a success code.  
   * Upon successful ClearPay confirmation, the order is created in our system with payment status = “paid” and an associated ClearPay transaction ID.  

3. Error Handling  
   * If ClearPay returns a decline (e.g. insufficient funds), user sees customised error copy (e.g. “Payment declined – please choose another method or contact ClearPay”) and can reselect a method.  
   * If network/API timeout occurs, user sees retry option and is not charged.  

4. Data & Observability  
   * Each ClearPay transaction logs: userID, orderID, ClearPay transactionID, status code, timestamp.  
   * Failed transactions emit an error metric/alert tagged “payment.clearpay.failure” in staging and production.  

5. Performance  
   * ClearPay option renders within 200 ms of page load under normal network conditions.

# Questions to Clarify  
1. Please provide the definitive list of supported EMEA country codes for ClearPay display.  
2. Is there a feature flag for rollout? If so, name, default state, and targeted environments?  
3. What is the exact copy for decline vs network-error messages, including translations?  
4. Where should ClearPay appear in the payment methods list (positioning)?  
5. Are there Figma/mock-ups for the ClearPay UI flow?  
6. What sandbox credentials and endpoints should QA use for ClearPay testing?

# High-Level Test Scenarios (Mapped to AC)  
1. Happy Path – Visibility & Success  
   * Region = FR (EMEA), feature flag on → ClearPay visible → complete payment flow → order status = paid + valid transactionID logged.  
2. Negative – Non-EMEA  
   * Region = US → ClearPay option does not display.  
3. Negative – Decline  
   * Simulate ClearPay decline response → decline message displayed → user can choose another payment method.  
4. Negative – Network/Error  
   * Simulate API timeout → network-error copy displayed → retry button functions without double-charging.  
5. Edge Cases  
   * Toggle feature flag off mid-session → ClearPay disappears upon refresh.  
   * Rapid multiple clicks on “Pay with ClearPay” → no duplicate orders created.  
6. Cross-Device/Browser  
   * Test visibility and flow on Chrome, Safari, Firefox on desktop and iOS/Android.  
7. Recovery  
   * After a decline, user retries via ClearPay sandbox → success path completes.  

# Observability & Evidence Plan  
* Validate browser console logs and backend logs include userID, orderID, ClearPay transactionID and status.  
* Confirm metrics/alerts for failure events in monitoring dashboard (e.g. Datadog/Grafana).  
* Capture screenshots of payment option display, success confirmation screen, decline/network-error messages, and logs snippet showing transactionID.
