User Story

As a user, I want to see the redesigned sign up modal and be automatically opted into loyalty when I create an account, so that there is no confusion about the loyalty experience.

Acceptance Criteria

UX should match Figma (Figma word is hyperlinked)

Apply Marmot styling and colors - Marmot style guide (this is hyperlinked)

User Story

As a user, I want to see the redesigned sign up modal and be automatically opted into loyalty when I create an account, so that there is no confusion about the loyalty experience.

Acceptance Criteria

UX should match Figma (Figma word is hyperlinked)

Apply Marmot styling and colors - Marmot style guide (this is hyperlinked)

Account benefits content asset (left on desktop/tablet modal, top on mobile modal)

T&Cs content asset should reflect in the storefront from SFRA

Email opt-in is controlled by site pref from SFRA

SMS opt-in phone number field

Error states

Loyalty should be opted in automatically upon account creation

Modal closes upon successful user registration

Modal closes if user clicks outside of the modal

Facebook sign up should be removed from the modal as it's no longer going to be an option for users to sign up via FB

Modal should adjust in height dependent on any error messages and the space those messages take

If new account modal is disabled, the existing flow should be present

For PWA sites, additional logic need to be added to show login pop up when user lands on homepage with /?modal=login parameters.
