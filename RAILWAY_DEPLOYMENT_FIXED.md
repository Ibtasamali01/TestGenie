# Railway Deployment - FIXED Configuration

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. **Configuration Conflicts Fixed**
- ✅ Standardized all configuration files to use `cd backend && gunicorn app:app`
- ✅ Removed conflicting start commands between `railway.toml`, `nixpacks.toml`, and `Procfile`
- ✅ All files now point to the same deployment strategy

### 2. **Gunicorn Configuration Fixed**
- ✅ Updated all start commands to use gunicorn with proper Railway configuration
- ✅ Set appropriate worker count (1) and timeout (120s) for Railway
- ✅ Configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` as required by Railway

### 3. **Backend Configuration Optimized**
- ✅ Set `debug=False` in backend/app.py for production
- ✅ Maintained proper PORT environment variable handling
- ✅ All services initialize correctly (TestGenie, EpicRoast, GroomRoom, Jira)

## Current Configuration Files

### railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "cd backend && gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"

[env]
PYTHONPATH = "."
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
providers = ["python"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["echo 'Build complete'"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120"
```

### Procfile
```
web: cd backend && gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Azure OpenAI (Required for GroomRoom)
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name
```

### Jira Integration (Optional)
```env
JIRA_SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token_here
```

### Optional Variables
```env
PORT=5000
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add all required environment variables listed above

### 2. **Deploy to Railway**
Choose one of these methods:

#### Option A: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Deploy via Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

#### Option C: Railway CLI
```bash
railway up --detach
```

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
After deployment, test these endpoints:

#### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "testgenie": true,
    "epicroast": true,
    "groomroom": true,
    "jira": true
  }
}
```

#### Test GroomRoom API
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/groomroom/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticket_content": "Test ticket for grooming", "level": "default"}'
```

## Verification Results

✅ **File Structure**: All required files present
✅ **Dependencies**: All Python packages can be imported
✅ **Backend Import**: Flask app imports successfully
✅ **Services**: All services (TestGenie, EpicRoast, GroomRoom, Jira) initialize correctly
⚠️ **Environment Variables**: Need to be set in Railway dashboard

## Expected Results After Deployment

- ✅ Railway build should complete successfully
- ✅ No more Nixpacks configuration errors
- ✅ Backend should start with gunicorn
- ✅ Health endpoint should return healthy status
- ✅ GroomRoom functionality should work without errors
- ✅ Frontend should connect to backend successfully

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard → Your project → Deployments
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Check build and runtime logs for specific errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all Azure OpenAI variables are set correctly
   - Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   python verify_railway_deployment.py
   ```

4. **Check File Structure**:
   - Ensure `backend/app.py` exists and is valid
   - Verify `backend/requirements.txt` includes gunicorn

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue**: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Check that all dependencies are in both root and backend requirements.txt

**Issue**: "Port already in use" errors  
**Solution**: Railway handles port assignment automatically via $PORT variable

**Issue**: "Gunicorn not found" errors
**Solution**: Ensure gunicorn==21.2.0 is in backend/requirements.txt

**Issue**: Health check failures
**Solution**: Verify /health endpoint returns 200 status with proper JSON

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard

3. **Monitor Deployment** in Railway dashboard

4. **Test the Deployed Application**:
   - Check health endpoint
   - Test GroomRoom functionality
   - Verify frontend-backend connection

The configuration is now properly set up for Railway deployment. The main remaining step is setting the environment variables in your Railway dashboard.
