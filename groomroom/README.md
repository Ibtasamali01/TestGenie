# GroomRoom - Concise Jira Ticket Refinement Guidance

GroomRoom provides concise refinement guidance for Jira tickets, following specific rules for professional ticket analysis.

## üîí Core Rules

- **No Given/When/Then** generation
- **No grooming checklist**, dependencies/blockers, sprint readiness scores, or improvement suggestions
- Keep answers **short**, in **UK spelling**, **bullet-based** where possible
- Output should be **‚â§ 300 words**

## üîç Focus Areas

1. **Ticket Summary** - 1‚Äì2 lines of story/bug context
2. **Key Gaps (Acceptance Criteria)** - Call out missing/unclear AC, rephrase vague AC into intent-based statements, or give 1‚Äì2 short example AC if missing
3. **Definition of Ready Gaps** - List missing essentials: AC, design links, PO sign-off, data/env/config notes
4. **Questions to Ask** - Short, direct clarifications for PO/Dev/QA to unblock
5. **Test Scenarios (High-Level)** - Happy paths, negative/error cases, risk-based checks, cross-browser/device coverage
6. **ADA / Accessibility (If Applicable)** - Screen reader/ARIA, focus order/keyboard navigation, labelling, contrast
