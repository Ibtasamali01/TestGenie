# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Conflicts
- **Problem**: Conflicting `railway.toml` and `nixpacks.toml` files in both root and backend directories
- **Solution**: Removed backend configuration files, standardized on root-level configuration

### 2. Build Command Issues
- **Problem**: Inconsistent build commands between configuration files
- **Solution**: Updated `nixpacks.toml` to install dependencies from both root and backend requirements.txt

### 3. Missing Environment Variables
- **Problem**: `env.example` missing Azure OpenAI configuration variables
- **Solution**: Added Azure OpenAI environment variables to support both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI

### 4. Inconsistent Dependencies
- **Problem**: Different OpenAI versions between root and backend requirements.txt
- **Solution**: Synchronized versions and added gunicorn to root requirements.txt

## Updated Configuration Files

### railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "cd backend && python app.py"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"

[env]
PYTHONPATH = "."
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python311", "pip"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pip install -r requirements.txt", "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["echo 'Build complete'"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && python app.py"
```

### Procfile
```
web: cd backend && python app.py
```

## Environment Variables Required

### For OpenAI (Option 1)
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### For Azure OpenAI (Option 2)
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name
```

### Optional Variables
```env
JIRA_SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token_here
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=your_teams_webhook_url_here
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
PORT=5000
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Local Setup
```bash
python verify_railway_deployment.py
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Navigate to your project
- Go to Variables tab
- Add all required environment variables

### 3. Deploy
- Push to your connected repository, OR
- Use Railway CLI: `railway up --detach`

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Test API endpoints
- Monitor logs in Railway dashboard

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Build should complete successfully
- ✅ All dependencies should install correctly
- ✅ App should start without import errors
- ✅ Health checks should pass
- ✅ GroomRoom functionality should work

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Test Locally**: Run `python verify_railway_deployment.py`
4. **Check File Structure**: Ensure all files are in correct locations

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to your Railway-connected repository
3. Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard
4. Test the deployed application
