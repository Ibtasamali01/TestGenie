# 🎯 Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Prompts with Given/When/Then Format

## ✅ **Enhancement Complete**

The Acceptance Criteria prompts have been successfully enhanced with comprehensive Given/When/Then format and user story analysis capabilities.

---

## 🔧 **Enhanced Features Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Prompt Instructions**
- **User Story Comparison**: "Compare the user story to its acceptance criteria"
- **Missing Criteria Detection**: "List any missing or ambiguous criteria"
- **Given/When/Then Suggestions**: "For each gap, suggest a precise Given/When/Then statement to fill it"
- **Bullet Format Integration**: Maintains existing Intent, Conditions, Expected Result, Pass/Fail Logic format
- **Timing & Accessibility**: Includes timing, accessibility, and fallback conditions

### **2. Enhanced Vague AC Pattern Detection**
All vague AC patterns now include comprehensive Given/When/Then suggestions:

#### **"match Figma" Pattern**
- **Intent**: User expects visual and behavioral consistency with design specifications
- **Conditions**: When user interacts with [specific component/page]
- **Expected Result**: [Component] displays and behaves exactly as shown in Figma frame [reference]
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: QA verifies visual match, interaction behavior, responsive breakpoints, and accessibility compliance
- **Given/When/Then**: Given the user is viewing [component/page], When they interact with [specific element], Then the visual appearance and behavior matches Figma frame [reference] with [specific interactions, responsive states, accessibility features]

#### **"works properly" Pattern**
- **Intent**: User expects correct implementation with proper error handling and edge case management
- **Conditions**: When [condition] occurs, including edge cases
- **Expected Result**: [Specific correct behavior] with [error handling for edge cases] and [performance requirements]
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: QA tests happy path, edge cases, error conditions, and performance benchmarks
- **Given/When/Then**: Given [condition] occurs, including edge cases, When the system processes the request, Then [specific correct behavior] happens with [error handling for edge cases] and [performance requirements]

#### **"looks good" Pattern**
- **Intent**: User expects visual elements to display correctly according to design specifications
- **Conditions**: When [component] is rendered in [specific context/environment]
- **Expected Result**: Visual elements display [specific appearance] with [color, spacing, typography, responsive behavior] matching [design reference]
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: QA verifies visual match across browsers/devices and accessibility compliance
- **Given/When/Then**: Given [component] is rendered in [specific context/environment], When the page loads, Then visual elements display [specific appearance] with [color, spacing, typography, responsive behavior] matching [design reference]

### **3. User Story vs AC Gap Analysis**
New functionality to analyze gaps between user stories and acceptance criteria:

#### **User Story Component Extraction**
- **User Role**: Extracts "As a [role]" from user stories
- **Desired Action**: Extracts "I want to [action]" from user stories
- **Business Value**: Extracts "so that [value]" from user stories

#### **Gap Detection**
- Compares user story components against acceptance criteria
- Identifies missing coverage for each component
- Generates specific Given/When/Then statements for gaps

### **4. Missing Criteria Detection**
Automatically identifies and suggests missing criteria patterns:

#### **Error Handling**
- **Given/When/Then**: Given an error occurs, When the system processes the request, Then appropriate error message is displayed and user can recover gracefully

#### **Accessibility**
- **Given/When/Then**: Given a user with accessibility needs, When they interact with the component, Then all accessibility requirements are met (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)

#### **Performance**
- **Given/When/Then**: Given the component loads, When user performs actions, Then response time is under [X] seconds and performance metrics are met

#### **Edge Cases**
- **Given/When/Then**: Given edge case conditions occur, When the system processes the request, Then appropriate handling is implemented without breaking functionality

#### **Validation**
- **Given/When/Then**: Given invalid input is provided, When the user submits the form, Then validation errors are displayed clearly and user can correct the input

## 📊 **Enhanced Output Format**

### **Vague AC Detection Section**
```
**⚠️ Vague AC Detected - Rewrite Suggestions:**
- **Original**: Vague AC: "match Figma" - define visual requirements and acceptance criteria
  **Rewrite as:**
  - **Intent**: User expects visual and behavioral consistency with design specifications
  - **Conditions**: When user interacts with [specific component/page]
  - **Expected Result**: [Component] displays and behaves exactly as shown in Figma frame [reference]
  - **Pass/Fail Logic**: QA verifies visual match, interaction behavior, responsive breakpoints, and accessibility compliance
  - **Given/When/Then**: Given the user is viewing [component/page], When they interact with [specific element], Then the visual appearance and behavior matches Figma frame [reference] with [specific interactions, responsive states, accessibility features]
```

### **User Story Gaps Section**
```
**🔍 User Story vs AC Gaps - Missing Coverage:**
- **Component**: User role: customer
  **Given/When/Then**: Given a customer, When they access the feature, Then they can perform their intended actions successfully
```

### **Missing Criteria Section**
```
**📋 Missing Criteria - Suggested Given/When/Then:**
- **Error Handling**: Given an error occurs, When the system processes the request, Then appropriate error message is displayed and user can recover gracefully
- **Accessibility**: Given a user with accessibility needs, When they interact with the component, Then all accessibility requirements are met (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
```
