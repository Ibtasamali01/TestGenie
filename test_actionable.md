## 🧪 Test Scenarios (Functional + Non-Functional)

### ✅ Positive Scenarios:
1. No filter panel visible on the left side of the product grid.
2. Filter bar is correctly positioned and styled as per design.
3. Only relevant quick filters display, up to maximum of 5, configurable by merch.
4. Flyout panel slides out; displays only the relevant filter; animation and controls match requirements
5. Filter application triggers immediate product refresh.
6. Action applies filter and closes flyout as designed
7. Flyout closes and UI returns to main PLP view.
8. Applied filters are shown correctly in the sticky bar.
9. Filter is removed and results are updated live
10. All filters removed and results show unfiltered product grid
11. All filters visible in collapsed state; UI/animation match Figma; panel closes as expected
12. Elements stay sticky and visible at all scroll positions

### ⚠️ Negative Scenarios:
1. Only applicable quick filters are visible. - Negative or Edge Cases
2. Invalid input shows appropriate error message with clear guidance
3. System prevents unauthorized access and maintains security boundaries
4. Boundary conditions are handled correctly (empty, null, max values)
5. Duplicate actions are prevented or handled appropriately
6. Required fields validation works correctly with user feedback
7. System prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks on all inputs
8. CSRF tokens are validated for all state-changing operations

### 🔥 Error/Resilience Scenarios:
1. System handles network timeout gracefully with retry mechanism
2. Database connection failure is handled with appropriate fallback
3. API errors return user-friendly messages and log technical details
4. Partial data loads are handled without breaking functionality
5. Session expiration redirects user appropriately with state preservation
6. Concurrent operations maintain data integrity without conflicts
7. Memory leaks are prevented during long sessions or repeated actions
8. Browser crashes or tab closes preserve critical user data

_Note: Test scenarios are testable, non-overlapping, and map directly to acceptance criteria. Ready for QA to convert into detailed test cases._

## 🧱 Technical / ADA / Architecture

### 💻 Implementation Details:
• Update PLP layout component to remove left filter panel
• Integrate new horizontal filter bar component above product grid
• Use existing filter API endpoints for data; no new API required
• Add configuration support for top 5 quick filters (Category, Size, Color, Fit, Price)
• Implement sticky behavior using CSS position: sticky and intersection observer for performance
• Apply Figma design tokens for consistent UI

### 🏗️ Architectural Solution:
• No backend schema changes required
• Reuses existing product listing API (no new endpoints)
• Filter logic handled client-side with existing Redux/Context state management
• Components designed to be reusable across other PLP variants (e.g., mobile, brand pages)
• Ensure horizontal filters integrate with existing analytics event tracking module

### ♿ ADA (Accessibility):
• Keyboard navigation: Tab, Enter, and Escape keys should fully control filter flyout
• Screen reader labels for filter names, close buttons, and applied filters
• Color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
• Focus state visible for all interactive elements
• Announce applied filter changes to screen readers (ARIA live region)

### 📊 NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements):
• **Performance:** Page should re-render filtered products within ≤500ms after filter selection
• **Security:** All API calls use HTTPS; ensure no PII exposure in filter analytics events
• **Reliability:** Filters must maintain state on page reload or back-navigation
• **Analytics:** Filter interactions should fire correct tracking events (category, filter type)
• **Accessibility:** Meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA

## 💡 Recommendations

### 📊 Product Owner (PO):
Define measurable KPIs: filter engagement rate (target ≥40%), time-to-first-filter (target ≤3s), conversion uplift (track +5% goal)
Ensure alignment with business objectives: validate filter order matches merchandising strategy and seasonal priorities
Plan A/B testing: control vs. new horizontal filters with 50/50 traffic split, measure for 2 weeks minimum

### 🧪 QA Team:
Expand test coverage to include:
  • Accessibility: keyboard-only navigation, screen reader announcements, focus management
  • Functional: verify all 5 quick filters load correctly, 'More Filters' opens full panel, applied filters display with remove (×) button
  • Performance: measure filter response time (target ≤500ms), validate sticky behavior on scroll, test horizontal overflow with 10+ filters
  • Analytics: validate key user interactions fire correct tracking events (clicks, form submissions)
  • Cross-browser: test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest 2 versions), document any browser-specific issues

### 💻 Dev / Tech Lead:
Implement smooth horizontal scroll with full keyboard navigation support (Arrow Left/Right, Tab, Home/End keys)
Optimize performance: use CSS `position: sticky` for filter bar, debounce filter API calls (300ms), implement virtual scrolling for 100+ filters
Add structured telemetry for user interactions:
  • Track: filter_opened, filter_closed, quick_filter_clicked, more_filters_opened, filter_applied, filter_removed, clear_all_clicked
  • Include metadata: filter_type, filter_value, applied_filters_count, time_to_interaction
Document error handling patterns and edge-case recovery within Confluence or codebase README (include retry logic, fallback states)
Code quality: add unit tests (target 80% coverage), write integration tests for critical paths, document component props/API contracts
