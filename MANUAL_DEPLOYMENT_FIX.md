# Manual Deployment Fix for GroomRoom Error

## Problem
The production backend at `https://craven-worm-production.up.railway.app` is showing the error:
```
'GroomRoom' object has no attribute 'generate_groom_analysis_enhanced'
```

This is because the deployed backend has an old version of the GroomRoom module that doesn't include the `generate_groom_analysis_enhanced` method.

## Solution
You need to redeploy the backend with the updated GroomRoom module.

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

4. **Deploy to Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway up --detach
   ```

### Option 2: Using Railway Dashboard

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Find your project: `craven-worm-production`

2. **Trigger Redeploy:**
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### Option 3: Using Git Push (if connected to GitHub)

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GroomRoom generate_groom_analysis_enhanced method"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** if it's connected to your GitHub repository.

## Verification

After deployment, test the fix:

1. **Check backend health:**
   ```bash
   curl https://craven-worm-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Test GroomRoom endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://craven-worm-production.up.railway.app/api/groomroom/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"ticket_content": "Test ticket", "level": "updated"}'
   ```

3. **Test in frontend:**
   - Visit: https://summervibe-testgenie-epicroast.vercel.app/
   - Go to Groom Room tab
   - Try generating an analysis

## Expected Result

After successful deployment, the GroomRoom functionality should work without the `'GroomRoom' object has no attribute 'generate_groom_analysis_enhanced'` error.

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables** in Railway dashboard:
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

3. **Check build logs** in Railway dashboard for any Python import errors

## Alternative: Quick Fix

If you can't deploy immediately, you can temporarily modify the backend code to use the existing method:

In `backend/app.py`, line 341, change:
```python
groom = groomroom.generate_groom_analysis_enhanced(ticket_content, level=level, debug_mode=debug_mode)
```

To:
```python
groom = groomroom.generate_groom_analysis(ticket_content, level=level)
```

This will use the existing method instead of the enhanced one, but you'll lose some debugging features.
