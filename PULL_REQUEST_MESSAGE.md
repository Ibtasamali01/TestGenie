### Before:
```
AC #1: Given a user... [20+ And clauses with excessive detail]
```

### After:
```
AC #1: Given a user is on the checkout page
When they reach the payment selection step
Then payment methods are displayed with clear icons
And checkout form is pre-populated for logged-in users
And total amount is displayed with itemized breakdown
And payment data is transmitted securely over HTTPS
And interface is responsive with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility
And form validation provides real-time feedback
And loading states shown during payment processing
And error handling displays actionable messages
And successful payment redirects to confirmation page
```

**Result:** Concise, professional, production-ready!
