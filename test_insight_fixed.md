# 🔍 Insight (Balanced Groom) — ODCD-34544 | PWA | MMT | Desktop | PLP Horizontal Filters
**Sprint Readiness:** 40% - Not Ready | **Coverage:** 40%

## 📋 Definition of Ready
- **Present:** acceptance_criteria, testing_steps, brands, components
- **Missing:** user_story, implementation_details, architectural_solution, ada_criteria, agile_team, story_points
- **Weak Areas:** User story format, Technical details, Accessibility requirements

## 🧩 User Story
_⚠️ User story missing. Suggested: "As a user, I want to filter design to be positioned horizontally above the product gr..., so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for."_

**Current Stage:** 🔴 In Discovery

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
**Detected:** 2 | **Quality:** 1/2 testable

### Key Criteria:
1. tions with either opens the flyout, with that specific filter section only. Applied filters display horizontally on PLP. Both filters and applied filters are sticky upon scroll. (≤300ms response time)
2. Annual Domain (Marmot) Projected Revenue: $600,550 (≤300ms response time)

_Missing NFRs:_ Security, Accessibility, Browser Compatibility

## 🧪 Test Scenarios
**Positive:** 12 | **Negative:** 8 | **Error:** 8

## 🧱 Technical / ADA / Architecture
### Implementation:
• Update PLP layout component to remove left filter panel
• Integrate new horizontal filter bar component above product grid
• Use existing filter API endpoints for data; no new API required

### ADA:
• Keyboard navigation: Tab, Enter, and Escape keys should fully control filter flyout
• Screen reader labels for filter names, close buttons, and applied filters
• Color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards

## 🎨 Design

## 💡 Key Recommendations
**PO:** Define measurable KPIs: filter engagement rate (target ≥40%), time-to-first-filter (target ≤3s), conversion uplift (track +5% goal)

**QA:** Expand test coverage to include:

**Dev:** Implement smooth horizontal scroll with full keyboard navigation support (Arrow Left/Right, Tab, Home/End keys)
