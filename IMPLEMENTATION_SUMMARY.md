# GroomRoom No-Scoring Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective Achieved**

Successfully implemented the comprehensive GroomRoom refactor that removes all framework scoring and produces context-specific outputs for all Jira card types, exactly as specified in the implementation prompt.

## âœ… **Key Requirements Implemented**

### 1. **Remove Framework Scoring Entirely**
- âœ… Deleted all ROI/INVEST/ACCEPT/3C score calculations
- âœ… Removed "ðŸ§­ Framework Scores" section from output
- âœ… Replaced with simple status: `Ready` / `Needs Refinement` / `Not Ready`
- âœ… Status determined by business rules, not numerical scores

### 2. **Enforce Non-Generic Suggested Rewrite**
- âœ… Always generates specific, value-oriented rewrites
- âœ… Includes at least one domain term from ticket (PayPal, ABTasty, SFCC-Checkout, etc.)
- âœ… Persona extraction from content
- âœ… Goal extraction from imperative requirements
- âœ… Benefit extraction from business context

### 3. **AC Rewrite Generation from Card Content**
- âœ… Normalizes existing ACs with domain terms
- âœ… Replaces banned generic phrases with specific requirements
- âœ… Adds timing constraints (â‰¤300ms, â‰¤1s)
- âœ… Includes Figma references when design links present
- âœ… Generates 5-7 contextual ACs if missing

### 4. **Test Scenarios Mapped from ACs**
- âœ… Scenarios generated by walking through rewritten AC list
- âœ… P/N/E classification (Positive/Negative/Error)
- âœ… Evidence hints for assertions
- âœ… Keyboard and screen reader scenarios for UI changes
- âœ… Domain-specific scenario generation

### 5. **Role-Tagged Recommendations**
- âœ… **PO**: Conflicts/decisions, missing KPIs, scope boundaries, A/B toggle guidance
- âœ… **QA**: Test gaps tied to ACs, analytics payload verification
- âœ… **Dev/Tech Lead**: Implementation artifacts, SDK versions, sequence diagrams
- âœ… Each recommendation references ticket nouns or AC IDs

### 6. **Figma Link Detection**
- âœ… Detects Figma links in HTML, Markdown, and Jira wiki formats
- âœ… Handles redirects and URL shorteners
- âœ… Extracts file keys and node IDs
- âœ… Maps links to their sections (Acceptance Criteria, Test Scenarios, etc.)
- âœ… Enables DesignSync when Figma links found in ACs

### 7. **Anchor Text Detection for "Figma"**
- âœ… Detects anchors where text is "Figma" or variants
- âœ… Case-insensitive matching
- âœ… Handles "Figma", "Figma link", "Figma design", "design (figma)"
- âœ… Validates that resolved URL is actually Figma
- âœ… Adds validation warnings for non-Figma URLs with "Figma" text

### 8. **Conflict Detection**
- âœ… Detects contradictory ACs (e.g., "immediately" vs "after delay")
- âœ… Adds "Conflicts" line under DoR
- âœ… Pins PO recommendation to resolve conflicts

### 9. **Output Schema (No Scores)**
- âœ… Structured data without framework scores
- âœ… Status-based readiness determination
- âœ… Context-specific content in all fields
- âœ… Domain-aware recommendations

### 10. **Linting Rules**
- âœ… Bans generic phrases: "valid input", "gracefully", "meets requirements", "works as expected"
- âœ… Auto-repair by re-deriving from Description/AC text
- âœ… Domain term injection for context

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### New Files Created:
- `groomroom/core_no_scoring.py` - Main implementation
- `test_no_scoring_groomroom.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `simple_test_no_scoring.py` - Basic functionality test
- `demo_no_scoring.py` - Demo script with PayPal example

### Modified Files:
- `app.py` - Updated to use GroomRoomNoScoring instead of GroomRoomVNext

### Key Classes:
- `GroomRoomNoScoring` - Main analysis class
- `DesignLink` - Figma link metadata
- `GroomroomResponse` - Structured response format

### Key Methods:
- `parse_jira_content()` - Robust parser with Figma detection
- `generate_suggested_rewrite()` - Domain-aware story rewrites
- `generate_acceptance_criteria_rewrites()` - Contextual AC generation
- `generate_test_scenarios()` - P/N/E scenario mapping from ACs
- `generate_recommendations()` - Role-tagged recommendations
- `detect_ac_conflicts()` - Contradictory AC detection
- `determine_status()` - Rule-based status determination

## ðŸ“Š **Example Outputs**

### PayPal Ticket (ODCD-34668):
```
Status: Needs Refinement
Suggested Rewrite: "As a shopper, I want the PayPal window to open immediately on the first PayPal CTA click at checkout so that I can reduce friction and complete payment faster."

ACs:
1. PayPal popup opens immediately (â‰¤300ms) on first CTA click via user gesture
2. Secondary PayPal CTA and helper copy are not rendered after first click
3. ABTasty PayPal patches are disabled during validation
4. If browser blocks popup, show inline message with Retry action
5. Focus returns to PayPal CTA when popup closes
6. Analytics log: paypal_cta_click, paypal_popup_opened, paypal_completed

Test Scenarios:
- Positive: Click CTA â†’ popup within â‰¤300ms; focus returns after completion
- Negative: Prevent double-click from spawning multiple popups
- Error/Resilience: Simulate popup blocked â†’ inline message + Retry opens popup

Recommendations:
- PO: Approve immediate-open behavior and ABTasty disablement
- QA: Add blocked-popup and keyboard-only activation tests
- Dev: Bind popup to user gesture; implement ABTasty kill-switch
```

## âœ… **Validation Results**

### No Framework Scores:
- âœ… No ROI/INVEST/ACCEPT/3C calculations
- âœ… No percentage-based readiness scores
- âœ… Rule-based status determination

### Context-Specific Content:
- âœ… Domain terms included in all outputs
- âœ… ACs derived from ticket content
- âœ… Scenarios mapped from ACs
- âœ… Recommendations reference ticket nouns

### Figma Integration:
- âœ… Anchor text detection for "Figma" variants
- âœ… Multi-format link parsing
- âœ… Section context mapping
- âœ… DesignSync enablement

### Quality Assurance:
- âœ… Banned generic phrases replaced
- âœ… Conflict detection for contradictory ACs
- âœ… Accessibility considerations for UI changes
- âœ… Role-specific recommendations

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Ready**

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. The new GroomRoom No-Scoring system provides:

1. **Thorough but score-free** analysis
2. **Context-specific** story rewrites, ACs, and scenarios
3. **Domain-aware** content generation
4. **Figma integration** with anchor text detection
5. **Conflict detection** and resolution guidance
6. **Role-tagged recommendations** for PO/QA/Dev teams

All requirements from the implementation prompt have been successfully implemented and tested.
