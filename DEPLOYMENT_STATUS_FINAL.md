⚡ Actionable Groom Report — TEST-123 | Apply Discount Codes
Sprint Readiness: 78% → ⚠️ Needs Refinement

📋 Definition of Ready
• Coverage: 75%
• Missing Fields: ["Implementation Details", "ADA Criteria"]
• Weak Areas: ["Edge case handling", "Error scenarios"]

🧭 Framework Scores
• ROI: 22 | INVEST: 18 | ACCEPT: 15 | 3C: 8
(Biggest blocker: 3C at 8)

🧩 User Story Review
• Persona: ✅ | Goal: ✅ | Benefit: ❌
Suggested Rewrite (concise, business-value oriented):
"As a customer, I want to apply discount codes during checkout so that I can save money on my purchase and increase my satisfaction."

✅ Acceptance Criteria (audit + rewrites)
• Detected: 4 | Weak/Vague: 2
Suggested Rewrites (non-Gherkin allowed, each testable & measurable):
1) Show 'Invalid code' message when a coupon is expired
2) If payment API times out (>10s), show retry CTA and preserve cart state
3) Announce modal title to screen readers when dialog opens

🧪 Test Scenarios (must include positive, negative, error)
• Positive: User successfully applies valid discount code | User sees updated total with discount
• Negative: User cannot apply invalid discount code | User sees error for expired code
• Error/Resilience: System handles API timeout gracefully | System recovers from network errors

🧱 Technical / ADA / Architecture
• Implementation Details: ⚠️ (Partial implementation details)
• Architectural Solution: ❌ (Missing architectural solution)
• ADA: ❌ (Keyboard navigation, Focus order, Alt text, Contrast)

🎨 DesignSync (if Figma linked)
• DesignSync Score: 75
• Mismatches:
  – Button states missing in ACs/tests
  – Error states not covered in design
• Changes detected: Updated button styling

💡 Role-Tagged Recommendations
• PO: Complete Implementation Details | Complete ADA Criteria | Clarify business value and ROI
• QA: Define comprehensive test scenarios (P/N/E) | Add error handling test scenarios | Add negative test scenarios for edge cases
• Dev/Tech Lead: Add implementation and deployment details | Define architectural solution and design | Add ADA compliance requirements
